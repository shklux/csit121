        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>This semester has been an amazing learning journey of web development. I learned the foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the various labs and assignments. Although sometimes challenging, each project was a further development in my coding skills and confidence.</p>
        <p>I learned to test my website on other browsers and devices, which taught me the use of responsive design and its compatibility. Media queries may change layouts to fit any screen size, ensuring a seamless user experience.</p>
        <p>This class has taught me the principles of modern web design, the importance of accessibility, and how to validate code for best practices. I am excited to apply this knowledge to many projects. Key takeaways include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Testing across multiple browsers and devices ensures usability.</li>
            <li>Validation tools are critical for clean, error-free code.</li>
            <li>Flexbox and media queries create dynamic, responsive designs.</li>
        </ul>
